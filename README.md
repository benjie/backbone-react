From Backbone To React
======================

You can [view the presentation
here](http://timecounts.github.io/backbone-react/), this repository
stores the source for the presentation and the demos.

The demos are deliberately very simple, and they function identically to
show how to move from Backbone to React simply.

You can view the demos in action here:

- [Backbone](http://timecounts.github.io/backbone-react/demos/backbone)
- [React](http://timecounts.github.io/backbone-react/demos/react)
